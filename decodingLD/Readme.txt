Cheeta v1.0 (C++) has the following main functions.

1、processes and parses genotype data from two chromosomes, and transfers it to the GPU for computing the LD metric r² using the classic haplotype frequency estimation method.

2、output either all cross-chromosome SNP-pair LD results or only those meeting specific filtering criteria (e.g., r² ≥ 0.8).

Note: The two functions are implemented by one command line.

command-line example:

cheeta interChromLDr2 -file0 file0.txt -file1 file1.txt -o output.txt [-threads threads per block] [-r2_cut cutoff] [-distribution dist_file]

parameters
cheeta: Perform interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium analysis

interChromLDr2: computes the LD metric r² between SNP pairs from different chromosomes:

-file0: input genotype data for chromosome 1;
-file1: input genotype data for chromosome 2;
-output: output either all cross-chromosome SNP-pair LD results, such as the LD metric r²;
-threads: Specify the number of threads, defaulting to 256;
-r2_cut: Specify specific filtering criteria of r², default r² is 0.8;
-distribution: Specify whether to output global LD distribution statistics, default is not;


The decodingLD is a decoding program used to convert binary LD files generated by cheeta into text files.
command line:
decodingLD -meta binary_ld.meta -outdir F:/text_ld_result -threads 32

parameters:
-meta The meta file of the binary LD results produced by cheeta. The first line indicates the number of SNPs on chromosome 1, the second line indicates the number of SNPs on chromosome 2, and the third line specifies the path to the binary LD results.
-outdir Specifies the output path for the text-format LD results.
-threads Specifies the number of threads to be used for decoding.
